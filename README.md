Dumping ground for anything I code that has no specific need for a repo, nothing more.

Be it for the use of others, any future employment portfolio, etc, etc.

mSL and VB6 will just get files added to (Well, mSL at least.), however C and Python will be added to and updated from time to time as I learn more about both languages.
